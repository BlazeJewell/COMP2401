# COMP2401
COMP2401B: Intro to Systems Programming (LEC) Fall 2020

## Assignments
I use "Assembly Coding Style" for commenting the code. Although it can make the lines longer than standard (125), it makes it easier for the TAs to visualise what the intentions of the given code sections is.
### Assignment #1
The goal For this assignment is to provide the end user with the ability to encrypt and decrypt messages, using a secret key. 

In order to prevent your enemies from easily cracking your encrypted messages, the algorithm that you implement will use an incrementing counter to encrypt each character in a slightly different way, similar to (but much simpler than) the Counter (CTR) mode of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric encryption algorithm. Your program will output the result (either the ciphertext or the plaintext) to the screen.

#### Learning Outcomes
With this assignment, you will:-
- get familiar with the Linux programming environment
- write a small program in C that is modular, and correctly designed and documented
- use bit masks and bitwise operators to manipulate values at the bit level
