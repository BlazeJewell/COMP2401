# COMP2401: Intro to Systems Programming
### Course Description
Introduction to system-level programming with fundamental OS concepts, procedures, primitive data types,user-defined types. Topics may include process management, memory management, process coordinationand synchronization, inter-process communication, file systems, networking, pointers, heap and stack mem-ory management, and system/library calls.
### Topics Covered
The course will cover the following topics, although some material may be omitted due to time constraints:
- Introduction to computer systemsâ€¢Data representation: primitive data types, compound data types, pointers
- Memory management: stack and heap, dynamic memory allocation, linked lists
- Program building
- Concurrent computing: concurrent systems, process management, IPC, threads
- Input/Output
- Program organization
- Graphics libraries and shell scripts
## Assignments
I use "Assembly Coding Style" for commenting the code. Although it can make the lines longer than standard (125), it makes it easier for the TAs to visualise what the intentions of the given code sections are.
### Assignment #1
The goal For this assignment is to provide the end user with the ability to encrypt and decrypt messages, using a secret key. 
In order to prevent your enemies from easily cracking your encrypted messages, the algorithm that you implement will use an incrementing counter to encrypt each character in a slightly different way, similar to (but much simpler than) the Counter (CTR) mode of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric encryption algorithm. Your program will output the result (either the ciphertext or the plaintext) to the screen.
#### Learning Outcomes
With this assignment, you will:
- get familiar with the Linux programming environment
- write a small program in C that is modular, and correctly designed and documented
- use bit masks and bitwise operators to manipulate values at the bit level
